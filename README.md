# Avalam_AI
Ai which uses adversarial search (Alpha Beta Pruning, score heuristics and Move heuristiscs) to play the board game Avalam, which is a zero sum game with complete information.

The "my_playerX.py" files, "Tree.py" file and "My_Avalam.py" files are the ones I wrote, the others were the game environment given by Polytechnique Montreal for the project.
